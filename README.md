Zelda Platformer
================

A simple ECS-based platformer game test featuring Link, made with C# and XNA.

The [C# Artemis ECS framework](https://github.com/thelinuxlich/artemis_CSharp) was used as the entity-component-system.

The map was built with [Tiled](http://www.mapeditor.org/) and is loaded with [XTiled](https://bitbucket.org/vinull/xtiled).

The Link sprites were found [here](http://gregarlink10.deviantart.com/art/Skyward-Sword-Link-sprites-275694168).
